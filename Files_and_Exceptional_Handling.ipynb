        "#Q1 Discuss the scenarios where multithreading is preferable to multiprocessing and scenarios where multiprocessing is a better choice.\n",
        "# ANS) Multithreading:-\n",
        "#i) Multithreading excels in situations where tasks spend a lot of time waiting for I/O operations to complete, such as reading from or writing to files, network operations, or user input. Threads can handle multiple I/O operations concurrently, improving efficiency.\n",
        "#ii) Threads share the same memory space, making it easier to share data between them without needing complex inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms. This can be advantageous if you have tasks that need to frequently access and update shared data.\n",
        "#iii) Threads are generally lighter weight compared to processes. They require less memory and have less overhead in terms of creation and context switching, making them suitable for applications where the overhead of spawning and managing processes is significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "#   Multiprocessing:-\n",
        "#i) For tasks that require significant computational power and can benefit from parallel execution, multiprocessing is often preferable. Processes run in separate memory spaces, allowing them to run truly in parallel on multiple CPU cores.\n",
        "#ii) Multiprocessing provides better isolation between tasks compared to multithreading. If tasks are completely independent or need to be isolated to prevent interference, processes are a better choice because they don't share memory space.\n",
        "#iii) Since processes are isolated, a crash in one process does not necessarily affect others. This can improve the stability and fault tolerance of the application. If one process encounters an issue, it can be terminated and restarted without affecting the overall system.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "#1. Reduced Overhead:\n",
        "#i) Creation and Destruction Costs: Creating a new process involves significant overhead, including time for initialization and memory allocation. By reusing processes, a process pool minimizes these costs.\n",
